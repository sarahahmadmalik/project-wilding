                    Sometimes youâ€™ve just got to do things yourself. Project Wilding was established in 2023 by a small team of environmentalists that are passionate about not only combatting climate change but restoring and nurturing our nature as well.
                    <p className='text-[16px] font-[400] text-left pt-4'>
                        We believe that by taking a ground-up approach, we can fight climate change, reverse biodiversity loss and get humans back to nature.

                    <p className='text-[16px] font-[400] text-left pt-4'>
                        The Project Wildling team is excited to embark on this journey of radical action, because drastic times call for dedicated action.
